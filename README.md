# Jax for strucure optimizaiton

With Jax to program the forward problem (thermal mechanical homogenization), leverage the auto-diff features of Jax to optimize microstructure with double negative thermal expansion coefficient and Poisson's ratio

# Gallary of design outputs

# Future work

Augment this small data set with developed [shape blending](https://github.com/cchu92/sdf_shape_blending) to train a generative model for inverse design
